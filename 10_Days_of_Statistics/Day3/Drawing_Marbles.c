# Day 3: Drawing Marbles
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?
If first marble drawn is red, bag now has 2 red marbles and 4 blue marbles
P(second marble is blue) = 4 / (2+4) = 4/6 = 2/3
Answer: 2/3
