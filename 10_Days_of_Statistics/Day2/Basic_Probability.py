# Day 2: Basic Probability
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.
= 1 - P(10) - P(11) - P(12)
= 1 - P(5,5 or 6,4) - P(5,6) - P(6,6)
= 1 - (1/6*1/6 + 2*1/6*1/6) - (2*1/6*1/6) - (1/6*1/6)
= 1 - (1/36 + 2/36) - (2/36) - (1/36)
= 1 - 6/36
= 1 - 1/6
= 5/6
Answer: 5/6
