You are given an array of integers, , denoting the marks scored by students in a class.

The alternating elements , ,  and so on denote the marks of boys.
Similarly, , ,  and so on denote the marks of girls.
The array name, , works as a pointer which stores the base address of that array. In other words,  contains the address where  is stored in the memory.

For example, let  and  stores 0x7fff9575c05f. Then, 0x7fff9575c05f is the memory address of .
